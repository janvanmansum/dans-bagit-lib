Description
===========

Library with classes and functions for working with the BagIt format.

BagIt is a set of hierarchical file layout conventions designed to support storage and transfer of arbitrary digital content. A "bag" consists of a directory
containing the payload files and other accompanying metadata files known as "tag" files. The "tags" are metadata files intended to facilitate and document the
storage and transfer of the bag. Processing a bag does not require any understanding of the payload file contents, and the payload files can be accessed without
processing the BagIt metadata.

This BagIt library is a software library intended to support the creation, manipulation, and validation of bags. Its current version is 0.97. It is
version-aware with the earliest supported version being 0.93.

See: <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8493>{:target=_blank}.

This library was first developed by the [LibraryOfCongress](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagit-java/){:target=_blank:} and forked by DANS-KNAW. The
original project does not seem to be actively maintained anymore, and DANS-KNAW has made some changes to the library to support its own use cases.
