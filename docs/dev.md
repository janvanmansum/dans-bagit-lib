Development
===========

This page contains information for developers about how to contribute to this project.


Requirements
------------

* Java 21
* Maven

Running tests and code quality checks
-------------------------------------

Inside the project root directory, run `mvn verify`.

General
-------

* When extending the library follow the established patterns to keep it easy to understand for any new user.

JavaDoc
-------
Since this is a library, the Javadocs should be relatively extensive, although there is no need to go overboard with this. At a minimum:

* The Javadocs must be generated successfully. As of today this is a standard part of the build; the build will fail if doc generation fails.
* [Run the documentation site locally](https://dans-knaw.github.io/dans-datastation-architecture/dev/#documentation-with-mkdocs){:target=_blank} to check how it
  renders.
